        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Sera was a habitable planet that was the homeworld of humanity. The planet had a 26-hour day.</p>
        <p>he topography consisted of a few very large, contiguous continents surrounded by the Serano Ocean, as well as several small island chains.</p>
        <p>Beneath the surface of Sera existed The Hollow, a honeycomb of tunnels and caverns permeating the planet's crust that was the home of the Locust Horde and the Lambent. Sera also possessed two moons.</p>
        <p>had a history of conflict that took it and its inhabitants to the brink of destruction. This shocked the people into a rejection of their destructive ways, leading to a golden age.</p> 
        <p>Although most conflict was solved peacefully, troublesome social issues such as civil liberties and crime remained.</p> 
        <p>A golden age of peace, culture, science, and the arts ensued, yet one problem still stood prominent: energy.</p>
        <p>Sera's sources of fossil and nuclear fuels were not sufficient to meet the rising global demand.</p>
        <p>Imulsion, with its promise of near limitless energy, was thought to be the solution to mankind's increasing need for energy and quickly became a key power source.</p>
        <p>However, the discovery of Imulsion caused a shift of political and economic power as well, instigating war between those countries fortunate enough to have large Imulsion reserves and those which were not. The conflict that ensued, known as the Pendulum Wars, raged on for 79 years.</p>
        <p>Pre-Emergence Day, Sera was host to many cultures and nations, including the world's two competing superpowers: the Coalition of Ordered Governments (COG), and the Union of Independent Republics (UIR), each a powerful alliance of multiple Imulsion-rich states and their allies.</p>
        <p>With the COG's victory in the Pendulum Wars, it claimed control of almost every country on Sera, minus a handful of stubborn holdouts such as Gorasnaya. Emergence Day introduced humanity to the genocidal Locust Horde, and the ensuing Locust War obliterated most countries and almost brought humans to the edge of extinction.</p>
        <p>The fate of the planet was put into further peril when the Lambent reach the surface of Sera and begin infecting all living organisms with the imulsion parasite, starting the Lambent Pandemic. Both wars are finally ended after the activation of the Imulsion Countermeasure Weapon, effectively wiping all of the Lambent and Imulsion and seemingly putting an end to the Locust Horde as well.</p>
        <p>Over the next twenty-five years, what remains of humanity sets out to rebuild civilization from the ruins of the old war.</p>
